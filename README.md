# Astronomy C162 Project

Repository for Alex Kennedy's and Chingham Fong's final project for C162. 

The goal is to determine if the Kepler 90 system can support an asteroid belt. 

Uses Python 3. It requires the Rebound package, which must be run on a unix system (use Linux subsystem for Windows).
